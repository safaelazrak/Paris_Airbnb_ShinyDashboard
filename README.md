# Paris_Airbnb_ShinyDashboard

Create a Shiny application that allows to explore the AirBnB data (Paris data). A minimal application should contains:

• Relationship between prices and apartment features, 
• Number of apartments per owner, 
• Renting price per city quarter (“arrondissements”), 
• Visit frequency of the different quarters according to time.

The data are available at https://plmbox.math.cnrs.fr/f/6b0e16bbf4974b78ba01/?dl=1

The application should be accompanied by a R markdown document explaining the different step of the analysis and providing some personal scientific comments on the data, based on statistical results.
